# JacksBlog Examples

## About

Here is the repo for code and examples used in [JacksBlog](https://jackchou.top/), mainly about colour science and image processing.

I'll try my best to make it nice and clean.

## Index

1. [CAT16 Reversibility](https://jackchou.top/posts/cat16-reversibility): About one- or two-step CAT16's reversibility.
2. [JPEG Structure](https://jackchou.top/posts/jpeg-structure): About JPEG/JFIF file structure and MPF (Multi-Picture Format).
3. [ISO 21496-1 Parser](): About parsing an ISO 21496-1 gainmap metadata in APP2.

## Usage

I use `uv` to manage the virtual environment. Most scripts only depend on `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `colour-science`. To reproduce my development environment, run:

```Bash
uv sync
```
